## Purpose of Project

For the Database Management System, the system is designed for use by a heavily enfranchised restaurant chain. The database will maintain a tracking of employee earnings throughout the entire company, keeping all of the varied branches in consideration. Such a database is necessary due to poor data management by other systems that the company has previously used. Employee earnings will be efficiently tracked based on multiple attributes including but not limited to: name, actualized earnings, city, and branch. These attributes will then be related so as to transgress to a more focused attribute pool. By using this system, a company will have unparalled precision when reviewing earning reports despite a heavy influx due to their large franchise numbers.
