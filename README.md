CSCE 315 Project 1: DBMS
=============

To build the project, simply run `make`. The compiled code will be in `bin/`. The project is known to work well on the TAMU Sun server.

### Parser Code Submission (Sept 16)

Please look at the [example input](ParserInput.md) and the [example output](ParserOutput.md). The input code was pasted directly into the terminal. The correct answer is given.

OPEN, CLOSE, and WRITE are not yet implemented.

### DBMS Engine Code Submission (Sept 9)

Please look at the [example output](output.md). The input is found in `src/main.cpp`. You can also compile the program as shown above and run `bin/project.out`.

We did not implement any comparison code in the select function. Our select function recieves a vector of integers that corresponds with the IDs of tuples in the relation. This vector of integers will be computed in the parser.
